# Online-Server
servers depending on client's location - each client can choose from options of licenses - each license has an expiration. Once expired, the session is over.

End to End - using MERN stack (react, mongodb, mongoose, redux toolkit as state management, antD for design, Sass)

Depending on client's location, an available server will be shown (each server has # capacity of users); client will choose a license he wishes to use; each license has an expiry time; once expired, the server will go offline and client will no longer be connected.
Client may use a license only once.
